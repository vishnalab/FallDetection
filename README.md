# Abstract

There is a persistent rise in the proportion of elderly individuals who choose to live independently in the community. They have a higher risk of falling, which may often result in deadly injuries owing to their older years and other health conditions. The purpose of the study provided in the article is to monitor the behavior of persons who are living alone in an environment in order to give prompt medical assistance to them in the event that they get injured and no one is around to observe. The vast majority of techniques that are based on the data collected from the video camera either need a lot of resources, or insufficient to generalize well across a range of locations. In order to solve this problem, an end-to-end neural network architecture that is built on transformers and has fewer parameters for real-time prediction at 30 frames per second has been created. The ultimate goal is to implement this design in resource-limited devices. We validate the method based on a variety of standard metrics, and it demonstrates excellent performance on the CMDFALL dataset, with a score of 93 percent, as well as good generalization capabilities on datasets that have not been seen before during training with the help of Self-attention mechanism.
